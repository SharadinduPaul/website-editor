## Note for the reviewer

I haven't committed separately for each feature, because I came to the submissions section(where it's mentioned to keep the commits clean) after the completion of the project. Apologies for that.

I decided not to use any external libraries, just to showcase my thinking process and skills. I can easily integrate this using libraries. Same goes with Tailwind CSS. (I have prior experience with Tailwind)

Please consider if anthing seems a bit off, because I keep the development time under 6 hours. There is some room for improvement which could be done if provided with more time.

Thanks for reviewing :)
