# App builder

I preferred not to use any external library for this project :)

## Installation

Install vite on your system, then run this command in the project directory to start the live server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```


## Note for the reviewer

I haven't committed separately for each feature, because I came to the submissions section(where it's mentioned to keep the commits clean) after the completion of the project. Apologies for that.
